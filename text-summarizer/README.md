# How to Build A Text Summarizer Using Huggingface Transformers
I am following [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-text-summarizer-using-huggingface-transformers/) course from freeCodeCamp by Manish Shivanandhan. As a study, the rest of the readme is written using the summarizer, which was given most of the tutorial text as input. 

## What is a summarizer?
A summarizer does exactly what its name suggests. It takes a large block of text and condenses it into a shorter version. The aim is to save time while still getting the essence of the content.

## Use Cases for a Summarizer
Summarizers are not just cool tech tricks. They serve real-world needs. Anyone who needs to process large amounts of text quickly can benefit from a summarizer.

## What are Hugging Face Transformers?
Hugging Face is a company that has created a state-of-the-art platform for natural language processing (NLP) Their Transformers library is like a treasure trove for NLP tasks.

## Building the model
This tutorial uses the Hugging Face transformers library. We use an annual report from FDA as input to get our summary. The model will generate a shorter version of the input text, capturing the most important or relevant information.

## Conclusion
Building a text summarizer with Hugging Face Transformers is not just about playing with cool technology. It's about harnessing the power of AI to make our lives a bit easier. Whether you're a student, a professional or just someone curious about NLP, the ability to quickly condense information is invaluable.
